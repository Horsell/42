##		42 School Work

###	Goal of this repository
Hi reader, if you are here you probably know about the basics of github.
To make it short this repository is a place to share my work at the shool 42 where
the basic course is supposed to be about 3 year long.
As it may not seem obvious 42.1 will be the folder where all projects of the first
year will be stored.

###	License
Every of those didactic projects will be open sourced, and released under the WTFPL
license.



#####Oh and btw
