##		42 School Work : [wiki](https://github.com/jpirsch/42/wiki)

###	Goal of this repository
Hi reader, if you are here you probably know about the basics of github.
To make it short this repository is a place to share my work at the shool 42 where
the basic course is supposed to be about 3 year long.
As it may not seem obvious 42.1 will be the folder where all projects of the first
year will be stored.


###	License
My work on these didactic projects is open sourced, and released under the GNU GPL license.
